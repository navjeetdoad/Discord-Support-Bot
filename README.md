# Discord-Support-Bot
A Discord Bot made in Python on Repl.it which detects sad messages in a channel and replies with encouraging messages. The bot can detect messages that may imply that the sender is in a crisis or is contemplating self harm, and provides a list of resources for them. Lastly, the bot also allows users to add and delete motivational/encouraging messages to the bot, which allows the bot to reply with these new messages. A list of commands are given below:

"$commands" gives a list of all commands <br />
"$responding-on" turns on the ability for the bot to reply to sad messages. <br />
"$responding-off" turns off the ability for the bot to reply to sad messages. <br />
"$addmsg message" adds message to the list of possible motivational messages. <br />
"$delmsg number" deletes the message at the index 'number' from the list of user-added messages. <br />
"$list" displays a list of all the user added messages. <br />

The bot uses UptimeRobot.com in order to keep running even when we close the program.
